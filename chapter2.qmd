# Literature Review

The application of machine learning in medicine has garnered enormous
attention over the past decade [@rabbani2022]. Artificial intelligence
(AI) and especially the subdiscipline of machine learning (ML) have
become hot topics generating increasing interest among laboratory
professionals. AI is a rather broad term and can be defined as the
theory and development of computer systems to perform complex tasks
typically requiring human intelligence, such as decision-making, visual
perception, speech recognition, and translation between languages. ML is
the science of programming, allowing computers to learn from data
without being explicitly programmed [@debruyne2021]. The ever more
extensive use of ML in clinical and basic medical research is reflected
in the number of titles and abstracts of papers indexed on PubMed and
published until 2006 as compared to 2007--2017, with a nearly 10-fold
increase from 1000 to slightly more than 9000 articles in that time
frame [@cabitza2018]. A literature review by Rabbani et al. found 39
articles about the field of clinical chemistry in laboratory medicine
between 2011 and 2021 [-@rabbani2022].

## A Brief Primer on Machine Learning

While this literature review aims not to provide an extensive
representation of the mathematics behind ML algorithms, some basic
concepts will be introduced to allow a sufficient understanding of the
topics discussed in the paper. ML models can be classified into broad
categories based on several criteria. These categories include the type
of supervision, whether are not the algorithm can learn incrementally
from an incoming stream of data (batch and online learning), and how
they generalize (instance-based versus model-based learning)
[@debruyne2021]. Rabbani et al. further classified the specific clinical
chemistry uses into five broad categories, predicting laboratory test
values, improving laboratory utilization, automating laboratory
processes, promoting precision laboratory test interpretation, and
improving laboratory medicine information systems [-@rabbani2022].

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Four important categories can be distinguished based on the amount and
type of supervision the models receive during training: supervised,
unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Training data
are labeled in supervised learning, and data samples are predicted with
knowledge about the desired solutions [@debruyne2021]. They are
typically used for classification and regression purposes. Some of the
essential supervised algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs),
Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forests (RFs), and supervised neural
networks. In unsupervised learning, training data are unlabeled. In
other words, observations are classified without prior data sample
knowledge [@debruyne2021]. Unsupervised algorithms can be used for
clustering (e.g., k-means clustering, density-based spatial clustering
of applications with noise, hierarchical cluster analysis),
visualization, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component
analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, locally linear embedding, t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding), anomaly detection and novelty detection
(e.g., one-class SVM, isolation forest) and association rule learning
(e.g., apriori, eclat). However, some models can deal with partially
labeled training data (i.e., semi-supervised learning). At last, in
reinforcement learning, an agent (i.e., the learning system) learns what
actions to take to optimize the outcome of a strategy (i.e., a policy)
or to get the maximum cumulative reward [@debruyne2021]. This system
resembles humans learning to ride a bike. It can typically be used in
learning games, such as Go, chess, or even poker, or settings where the
outcome is continuous rather than dichotomous (i.e., right or
wrong)[@debruyne2021]. The proposed study will use supervised learning,
as the data is labeled, and a particular outcome is expected.

### Model Types

#### Random Forests

Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple
decision trees to make predictions or classify data. It was first
introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001 and has since gained popularity due to
its robustness and accuracy [@liaw2002]. The algorithm creates many
decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data using
bootstrap aggregating or "bagging." The random forests algorithm (for
both classification and regression) is as follows:

1.  Draw ntree bootstrap samples from the original data.

2.  For each bootstrap sample, grow an unpruned classification or
    regression tree, with the following modification: at each node,
    rather than choosing the best split among all predictors, randomly
    sample mtry of the predictors and choose the best split from among
    those variables. (Bagging can be considered a special case of random
    forests obtained when mtry = p, the number of predictors.)

3.  Predict new data by aggregating the predictions of the ntree trees
    (i.e., majority votes for classification, average for regression)
    [@liaw2002].

Random forests offer several advantages that make them well-suited for
predictive modeling in healthcare:

1.  Robustness: Random forests are less prone to overfitting than
    individual decision trees. The aggregation of multiple trees helps
    to reduce the impact of outliers and noise in the data, resulting in
    more stable and reliable predictions.

2.  Variable Importance: Random forests provide estimates of the
    importance of different features in making predictions. This
    information aids in feature selection, identifying the most
    influential factors, and gaining insights into the underlying data
    relationships.

3.  Handling Complex Data: Random forests can take various data types,
    including categorical and numerical features, without extensive
    preprocessing. This flexibility makes them suitable for healthcare
    datasets often comprising diverse variables [@breiman2001a].

#### Gradient Boosting

Gradient boosting machines (GBMs) are an extremely popular machine
learning algorithm that have proven successful across many domains and
is one of the leading methods for winning Kaggle competitions. Whereas
random forests build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build
an ensemble of shallow trees in sequence, with each tree learning and
improving on the previous one. Although shallow trees by themselves are
relatively weak predictive models, they can be "boosted" to produce a
powerful "committee" that, when appropriately tuned, is often hard to
beat with other algorithms [@boehmke2020]. Gradient boosting involves
the following key steps:

1.  Building an Initial Model: The algorithm creates an initial model,
    typically a simple decision tree, to make predictions.

2.  Calculation of Residuals: The residuals represent the differences
    between the actual values and the predictions of the current model.

3.  Fitting Subsequent Models: Subsequent weak models are trained to
    predict the residuals of the previous model. These models are fitted
    to minimize residual errors, typically using gradient descent
    optimization.

4.  Ensemble Creation: The predictions of all the weak models are
    combined by summing them, creating a strong predictive model.

5.  Iterative Improvement: The process is repeated for multiple
    iterations, with each new model attempting to reduce further the
    errors made by the previous models[@chen2016].

Gradient boosting offers several advantages that include:

1.  High Predictive Accuracy: By combining multiple weak models,
    gradient boosting can achieve high predictive accuracy, often
    outperforming other machine learning algorithms.

2.  Handling Complex Relationships: Gradient boosting can capture
    complex nonlinear relationships between input and target variables,
    making it suitable for datasets with intricate patterns.

3.  Robustness to Outliers and Noise: The iterative nature of gradient
    boosting helps reduce the impact of outliers and noise in the data,
    leading to more robust predictions [@chen2016].

### Machine Learning Workflow

Since this study will focus on supervised learning, the review will
focus on that. Machine learning can be broken into three broad steps,
data cleaning and processing, training and testing the model, and
finally, the model is evaluated, deployed, and monitored
[@debruyne2021]. In the first phase, data is collected, cleaned, and
labeled. Data cleaning or pre-processing is one of the essential steps
in designing a reliable model [@debruyne2021]. Some examples of common
pre-processing steps are the handling of missing data, detection of
outliers, and encoding of categorical data. Data at this stage is also
split into training and testing data, typically following somewhere near
a 70-30 split. These two data sets are used for different portions of
the rest of the model building. The Training set data is used to develop
feature sets, train our algorithms, tune hyperparameters, compare
models, and all the other activities required to choose a final model
(e.g., the model we want to put into production) [@boehmke2020]. Once
the final model is selected, the test set data is used to estimate an
unbiased assessment of the model's performance, which we refer to as the
generalization error [@boehmke2020]. Most time (as much as 80%) is
invested into the data processes stage. After feature engineering, an ML
model is trained and tested on the collected data in the second phase.
Feature engineering is performed on the training set to select a good
set of features to train on. The ML model will only be able to learn
efficiently if the training data contains enough relevant features and
minimal irrelevant ones [@géron2019]. The data is then run through
various models, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs),
and Random Forests (RFs).

Once a model is selected, the third phase begins to evaluate the model's
performance. Historically, the performance of statistical models was
primarily based on goodness-of-fit tests and the assessment of
residuals. Unfortunately, misleading conclusions may follow from
predictive models that pass these assessments [@breiman2001]. Today, it
has become widely accepted that a more sound approach to assessing model
performance is to determine the predictive accuracy via loss functions
[@boehmke2020]. *Loss functions* are metrics that compare the predicted
values to the actual value (the output of a loss function is often
referred to as the error or pseudo residual). When performing resampling
methods, we assess the predicted values for a validation set compared to
the actual target value. The overall validation error of the model is
computed by aggregating the errors across the entire validation data set
[@boehmke2020]

### Machine Learning in the Clinical Laboratory

Rabbani et al. performed a comprehensive study of the current state of
machine learning in laboratory medicine [-@rabbani2022]. This study
revealed several exciting applications, including predicting laboratory
test values, improving laboratory utilization, automating laboratory
processes, promoting precision laboratory test interpretation, and
improving laboratory medicine information systems. In these studies,
tree-based learning algorithms and neural networks often performed best.

## Reflex Testing

The laboratory diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction relies on the
measurement of circulating concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH), free
thyroxine (fT4), and, in some cases, free triiodothyronine (fT3). TSH
measurement is the most sensitive initial laboratory test for screening
individuals for thyroid hormone abnormalities [@woodmansee2018]. TSH and
fT4 have a complex, nonlinear relationship, such that small changes in
fT4 result in relatively significant changes in TSH [@plebani2020]. Many
clinicians and laboratories check TSH alone as the initial test for
thyroid problems and only add a Free T4 measurement if the TSH is
abnormal (outside the laboratory's normal reference range). This is
known as reflex testing [@woodmansee2018]. Reflex testing became
possible with the advent of laboratory information systems (LIS) that
were sufficiently flexible to permit modification of existing test
requests at various stages of the analytical process [@srivastava2010].
Reflex testing is widely used, the principal aim being to optimize the
use of laboratory tests. However, the common practice of reflex testing
relies simply on hard-coded rules that allow no flexibility. For
instance, in the case of TSH, free T4 will be added to the patient order
whenever the value falls outside the established laboratory reference
range. This brings into the fold the issue that the thresholds used to
trigger reflex addition of tests vary widely. In a study by Murphy, he
found the hypocalcaemic threshold to trigger magnesium measurement
varied from 1.50 mmol/L up to 2.20 mmol/L [-@murphy2021]. Even allowing
for differences in the nature, size, and staffing of hospital
laboratories and populations served, the extent of the observed
variation invites scrutiny [@murphy2021].
